# 第五章 聖書の証言
CHAPTER V. SCRIPTURE TESTIMONIES.
The value of testimonies upon this subject cannot be questioned. They are entirely Scriptural; and they often bring the Gospel down to the personal level and contact of the sufferer, as mere abstract teaching cannot do. But they should always be simple, modest, as impersonal as possible, and illustrate principles. This is the character of all the Scripture testimonies. We shall glance at a few of these.
この主題に関する証言の価値は疑念の余地がありません。証言というものはきわめて聖書的な概念です。証言はしばしば福音を個人的レベルにまで嚙みくだき、苦しんでいる者にメッセージを届けてくれます。そうしたことは抽象的な教えにはできません。とはいえ、証言はいつもシンプルで、控えめで、できるかぎり一般的で、原理原則の例示となるものであるべきです。これが聖書にある数々の証言の特徴です。その中からいつくかを選んで、簡単に見ていきましょう。

THE CASE OF JOB. Job i., etc.
## ヨブの場合（ヨブ記一章、他）

This is the earliest case fully detailed in the Scriptures. 1. His sickness came from Satan's touch. His agency in sickness is most distinctly taught by our Lord also, and his power is yet undiminished.
ヨブのケースは詳細に書かれた証言の中で聖書に登場する最初期のものです。

（一）　ヨブの病はサタンの手によってもたらされました。サタンの使いが病気に関わっているという事実は、私たちの主もはっきりと教えてくださっています。サタンの勢力は今も衰えていません。

2 Job's sickness was divinely permitted. It was designed to lead him to search his heart, and see his utter need of sanctification.
（二）　ヨブの病は神に許可されていました。その目的は、ヨブを導いて自分の心を調べさせ、徹底的にきよめられる必要性をわからせるためでした。

3 His sickness did not sanctify him, but only led to deeper exhibitions of his sin, and self-righteousness. Sickness does not purify anyone, although it may lead us to see our need of holiness and to receive it from God.
（三）　病それ自体がヨブをきよめたのではなく、自分の罪と自己義認をより深く表出するよう導いたにすぎません。病は人をきよめませんが、聖性にあずかる必要に目覚めさせ、神からそれを受け取るようにと案内することがあります。

4 His sickness was removed when he saw his sin and acknowledged it before God. This came to him when God revealed Himself.
（四）　ヨブの病は、罪を認めて神に告白したときに除かれました。神がご自分を現されたときに、そうなりました。
Then he cried: "Now mine eye seeth Thee: wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." Then came his complete justification, and with it a spirit of forgiveness and love for his enemies.
ヨブは声をあげました。「今、この目であなたを見ました。それで私は自分をさげすみ、ちりと灰の中で悔いています」（ヨブ四二・五〜六）。そのときにヨブは完全に義とされ、敵を赦し愛する霊をいただきました。
And then, as he prayed for them, the Lord turned his own captivity. When we get right with God, we do not need to pray a great deal for ourselves. As we pray for others, our own blessing will often come. Job's healing made all things new, and all his blessings were doubled. And no doubt the spiritual blessing was the deepest of all.
ヨブが友のために祈ると、主はヨブ自身の束縛を解きました。私たちは自分自身のためにあまり多く祈る必要はありません。他人のために祈るときにこそ、私たち自身の祝福が来るものです。ヨブの癒しはすべてを新しくし、すべての祝福が二倍になりました。霊的祝福があらゆる祝福の中で最も深いものであるのは言うまでもありません。

How instructive to watch this case lying in the hands of God until the soul is ready to learn his spiritual lesson, and then receive from God's own hand life and restoration!
なんと示唆的なことでしょうか！　霊的教訓を学ぶ用意ができるまで魂は神の御手の中にあり、用意ができると神ご自身の御手からいのちと復興を受け取るようになるのです。

THE WOUNDED ISRAELITES AND THE BRAZEN SERPENT. Num. xxi.
## 傷ついたイスラエルと青銅の蛇（民数記二一章）

1 This sickness came from sin. They murmured, and God gave them something to murmur for. It is a serious matter to complain, for it is sure to bring the thing we fear, or a worse "I feared a fear, and it came upon me."
（一）　この病の由来は罪でした。イスラエルはつぶやいたので、神はイスラエルにつぶやきの種となるものを与えました。不満をこぼすという行為は深刻な問題です。それは私たちの恐れているものを運んでくるばかりか、さらに悪い結果になります。「私の最も恐れたものが、私を襲い、私のおびえたものが、私の身にふりかかったからだ」(ヨブ三・二五)

2 This sickness came from Satan; from the serpent. So, still, he stings our life, and poisons our blood. It was a fiery serpent. The Hebrew words are "The serpents, the seraphims." All our spiritual adversaries are not groveling worms. Many of them are lofty and transcendently wise.
（二）　この病の由来は蛇、つまりサタンでした。今でもサタンが私たちのいのちに噛みつき、血に毒を送ります。それは燃える蛇でした。ヘブル語では「蛇、セラフィム」となっています。私たちの霊的な敵は地をはう虫とは限りません。多くの場合、高貴な姿であり、人知を超えた賢さをそなえています。

3 The remedy was in the likeness of the disease; in short, a figure of the serpent with the poison extracted, and a striking intimation to the suffering camp and a sin-stricken world that Satan is robbed of his sting, and sickness and sin are but mere shadows of their former selves.
（三）　病の治療法は病が入ったときと似ていました。つまり、毒を抜かれた蛇の形でした。蛇の形は、病に苦しむイスラエルの野営と、罪に屈した世にとって、サタンの牙を抜くという勝利の象徴でした。病と罪は両方ともかつて猛威をふるったサタンの影にすぎないという事実を伝えています。
There was also in that brazen serpent the thought of Jesus made for us, Jesus assuming the vile and dishonored name of sinful man, and counted by God, and treated by men, as if He were indeed a serpent and a criminal. Thus for us has He taken the sting from Satan, sin, and death, and hung upon the uplifted cross the trophy of victory.
また私たちにとっては、青銅の蛇はイエスを思わせます。イエスは罪人の名前を引き受けて恥と屈辱を負い、神にも罪人に数えられ、人にも罪人として扱われました。まるで本当に犯罪人に――蛇に――なったかのようでした。ですから、イエスはサタンの牙を抜き、罪と死を無力化し、勝利の冠として十字架にあげられたのです。

4 The healing came by looking at the Brazen Serpent. There is unspeakable power in a look. A look of evil chills the soul. A look of purity and love transfigures it. The eye brings into the soul the object of vision. Looking to the sun, it is present in the eye. Looking unto Jesus brings His life into our whole being. This was physical life. The same life still comes from the cross for both soul and body, while we look unto Jesus.
（四）　青銅の蛇を見上げることによって癒しが訪れました。見ることには言葉にならないほどの力があります。悪を見ることは魂を凍りつかせます。純粋さと愛を見ることは魂を美しく形作ります。目が魂の中に見えているものの本質をもたらします。太陽のほうを見れば、太陽が目の中に入ります。イエスを見つめることは、私たちの存在そのものにイエスのいのちをもたらします。これは肉体的ないのちです。私たちがイエスを見つめるなら、魂のためにも肉体のためにも、同じいのちが今でも十字架から流れ込みます。

## ナアマン（第二列王記五章）
NAAMAN. II. Kings v.

1 This was a typical case of disease. Leprosy was the peculiar type of sin, destroying both soul and body. It was the especial stigma of the physical effects of sin.
（一）　これは病気の典型例でした。らい病は、魂と肉体を滅ぼす特定の罪の型です。罪の肉体的影響を示す固有のしるしです。

2 The instrument of this cure was, in the first instance, a Hebrew maid; and in her great usefulness we learn how God can use a very humble messenger and an incidental word. Indeed, Naarnan's own servants, a little later, saved his blessing for him by their wise counsel.
（二）　この病を癒すために用いられたのは、最初の例によるとヘブル人の娘でした。彼女が大きな貢献をした事実から、神は非常に卑しい者の取るに足りない言葉によってみことばを伝えることがあるということを私たちは学びます。じっさい、少しあとでナアマンのしもべが知恵に富んだ助言をして、ナアマンを祝福に導きました。

3 The lesson of humble and Obedient Faith must next be learned. The proud self and will of Naaman must die before his body can be healed by the Divine touch. And so Elisha meets his splendid state with quiet independence, and sends him a simple and humbling message to wash seven times in the Jordan and be clean. The sick are often deeply wounded by our seeming neglect, but God sometimes teaches them thus the lowliness of faith, and takes their thoughts of themselves and others, Naaman, like all other proud sinners, at first refuses the cross, and is about to lose his blessing when a word of honest frankness from his servants brings him to his senses, and sends him to Jordan.
// 後半の訳が難しい。自信がない。
（三）　次に学ばなければならない教訓は、謙遜と従順の信仰です。肉体が神の御手に触れて癒やされてる前に、ナアマンの高ぶる自己と自我が死ななければなりませんでした。そのため、静かで自立心のあるエリシャが晴れ着を着て、ナアマンにシンプルで謙遜を要求する言葉を伝えました。ヨルダン川で七度身を洗ってきよくなるという内容でした。病人は人に無視されたと感じてしばしば深く傷ついているものですが、神がこのように病人の心の思いを取り扱って、へりくだりの信仰を教えてくださることがあります。ナアマンも他の傲慢な罪人と同じように、はじめは十字架を拒み、あやうく祝福を逃しそうになります。ナアマンのしもべの正直で率直な言葉が、ナアマンの心を動かし、ヨルダン川に行かせました。

4 The Faith of Naaman consisted in his doing just what the prophet told him. He took God's way without qualification, and he persevered in it till his blessing came. Perhaps the first or second or sixth time there was no sign of healing; but he pressed on, and at length the wondrous blessing came, the flesh of a little child, and the acknowledgment and sole worship of the great Jehovah he had found.
（四）　ナアマンの信仰は、預言者の伝えたことをそのまま実行したという点にポイントがあります。ナアマンは無条件に神の方法に従い、そこにとどまったので、祝福をいただきました。もしかすると一度目も、二度目も、六度目も癒しの兆候は現れなかったかもしれません。それでも続けました。最後に驚くべき祝福が来ました。子供のようにすべすべの肌になりました。こうして偉大なヤハウェに感謝し、神にのみ礼拝を捧げました。

5 His request for a gift of earth from the place of his healing was a beautiful foreshadowing of that Earnest of the greater future whom we also receive, the Holy Ghost. The word earnest means a handful of soil. Naaman took home with him a handful of Canaan's soil; and we, in our healing, receive the earnest of the Spirit, a part of Heaven begun on earth.
（五）　ナアマンが癒やされた場所の土を持ち帰ることを願ったことは、将来私たちも受け取る手付金である聖霊の、美しい予表です。手付金（earnest）という言葉にはひと握りの土という意味があります。ナアマンはカナンの大地からひと握りの土を持ち帰りました。私たちも癒しによって御霊の手付金をいただきます。その手付金とは、天の一部分が地上において始まったことの保証です。

6 It is beautiful to see how Elisha sends him away leaning only on God. To his question about bowing in the house of Rimmon, Elisha will give no direct answer, but throws him on God alone, and bids him go in peace. How little man appears in all this! and how simple and glorious is God!

7 But Satan, too, must have a hand. And he usually shows his hand in some mercenary scheme like Gehazi's. So still, spiritualism and kindred arts of Satan seek to make merchandise of the things of God. But if you look closely, you will see the leper hand and face as white as snow.

HEZEKIAH. II. Kings xviii. 1. It was a hopeless case. All men's reasonings about the part that the remedy had in curing him ought to be set at rest by the fact that he was beyond the reach of every remedy, for even God had said that he should die, and not live. Man and means could, therefore, have nothing to do with his cure; it was wholly Divine. 2. He turned to God in humility. He made no attempt to find help from man. He threw himself helplessly on the mercy of the Lord. His prayer was not a very trustful one; but God heard his helpless cry, and sent deliverance. 3. The answer to his prayer was definite and clear. Fifteen years more of life from God Himself. It was sent to Isaiah, and communicated to him; and he at once believed it, and began to praise. 4. It was accompanied by a double sign. First a reversal of the dial 15 degrees, and then a poultice of figs. Both are called signs. The figs were not medicinal, for medicine was of no avail, but symbolical, and therefore administered by a prophet, not a physician. 5. The sequel of his healing was unworthy of it. Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit, but his heart was lifted up, and long years afterwards the bitter fruits of his sin and folly continued to prove how solemn a thing it is to receive God's great mercies, and how sacredly our redeemed lives must be used for Him. People are always asking, " Did not Hezekiah's case prove the rightness of using remedies?" No. It proved the rightness of doing exactly what God tells us in regard to our healing. God told Naaman to wash in the Jordan. Anything else would have been disobedience. God told Hezekiah to use figs. Anything else would have been disobedience. If God had told us to use figs, anything else would be disobedience. But God has told us to use the anointing oil and the prayer of faith, and is anything else genuine obedience?

THE NOBLEMAN'S SON. John iv. This was Christ's first miracle of healing. It seems to speak peculiarly to our own times. 1. It teaches us that we do not need the physical and visible presence of Jesus to heal us. He was far from this sick child and simply spake a word of power, which crossed these intervening spaces with Almighty energy, even as it still can reach from Heaven to earth. "Oh, if He were only here!" you say. Nay, His first great miracle was performed from a distance perhaps as great as between earth and Heaven. 2. It was by simple, naked faith, without sight or signs. The Lord Jesus had to press this farther away from all but His own simple word, "Except ye see signs and wonders," He exclaimed, "ye will not believe." And then He tested his faith by a simple word, "Go thy way; thy son liveth;" and the man accepted the hard lesson, believed the naked word, and the child was made whole. He showed his faith by quietly going back and ceasing any more to clamor for the Lord's going. 3. This case began at a fixed moment, and developed quietly and gradually, as so many are now healed. "He inquired at what hour he began to amend." And the answer was that at a certain moment the fever broke. He was now convalescent. So still the dear Master works for all who trust Him. Faith has both its instants and its hours. We must learn to accept both; to count the death-blow struck at the moment of our believing, and then to follow on as it works out all its stages of blessing.

THE HEALING OF PETER'S MOTHER-IN-LAW. Mark i. This was Christ's second recorded miracle of healing. He had just come from the Synagogue where, amid the astonishment of the people, He had cast out a demon. Peter's wife's mother was lying sick of fever. It was, then, a case of ordinary disease. And yet our Lord distinctly recognizes another agency at the back of the fever. For "He rebuked the fever," and this implies some personal and evil agent that must have caused it. He would not rebuke a mere natural law. There is no blame where there is no personal will. Nay, the fever was but the blistering touch of a demon hand; and this was what He rebuked. Next, she must actively take hold of the healing power which He stands over her to administer. He took her by the hand, and lifted her up, and she arose. There was of course, His mighty touch and Almighty help. But there was also her co-operation, her grasping His extended hand, her shaking of the torpor and weariness of disease, her effort to arise, and her rising. Thus we must meet His help and power. And then there was the use of her new strength in ministering to Him and them. This was the best proof of healing, the best use of it too. So must we ever give our new life to God, and in ministering to others and forgetting ourselves, we shall find our own strength continually renewed. As we give our life we shall save it; and as we serve others He will administer to all our needs. It is a blessed exchange of responsibility and care to find that we have nothing to do but live for Him, and He but one business, to live for us, and supply all our need.

THE HEALING OF THE MULTITUDE. Matt. viii. The next cases of healing we read of in the life of Christ were a large number of promiscuous cases on the evening of the Sabbath on which He healed Peter's mother-inlaw. They had been gathering all day long, and waiting until the Sabbath was past. And as soon the hour of six o'clock had come, they pressed upon Him from every side, in great numbers and variety, and He healed them all. Now the first lesson we learn from these cases is connected with this very fact, that they waited until the Sabbath was past. It shows how exactly their prevalent ideas of healing resembled the godless ideas of our own secular age. They considered the body, and all that pertained to it, to be purely secular. Healing, therefore, was a mere secular calling, and, as such, unfit work for the holy Sabbath day. Is not this just what modern unbelief has taught the churches of Christendom? The cure of the body is a matter for natural laws and remedies, and secular physicians, a profession to be studied and used for secular profit like any other business, but in no sense as sacred and holy as the salvation and culture of the soul. For the present our Lord met them on their own ground; but the day soon came when He deliberately and purposely healed on the Sabbath day, that He might repudiate and trample down this absurd and godless idea, and show to men that the body was as sacred as the soul; that its restoration was as much part of God's redemption; that it in no sense was left to be the subject of mere professional treatment; that it was His own holy prerogative and business to heal it; and that it was as holy and sacred work for the Sabbath day as the worship of the Temple or the salvation of the souls of men. The next lesson taught by these cases is the universality of His healing. He healed all that had need. He wished to show that it was not for favorite cases like the mother-in-law of an Apostle, but for all poor, sinful, suffering lives that could trust Him. And the highest and most helpful of all the lessons is the way in which these cases are linked with the prophecy in Isaiah, announcing the true character of the Messiah as the Bearer of Sickness and Infirmity. It was no mere incidental fact, therefore, that He was healing these sufferers; it was no special and exceptional display of His power as the Son of God. But it was the real purpose and design of His Messiahship; and so all the ages can come to Him and lay upon Him their burdens and pains. How deep and full these words, "Himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses!" Himself, not Himself and physicians, but Himself alone; Himself, not Himself and us, but He takes the whole burden Himself, and leaves us utterly free; Himself, then the healing cannot be had apart from having Him. It is all wrapped up in Himself. His life in us, His indwelling, His body, His flesh; and His bones. Himself took and bare, not merely once, but for ever, not only lifting, but keeping, and carrying for ever. Blessed Healing! Blessed Healer!

THE LEPER. Mark i. This occurred soon after, in one of Christ's tours through Galilee. 1. The request of-this man is a good specimen of the state of mind in which we find the average Christian. He has full confidence in the power of Christ to heal, but is very uncertain about His willingness. Now if a friend is going to doubt me at all, I should much rather he would come to me and say, "I am sure you would help me if you could," than "I know you have it in your power to aid me, but I have little confidence in your disposition to do it." When will men see that this easy goodnatured talk about God's will involves the most subtle and offensive distrust? 2. Christ's answer to him is explicit and emphatic and ought to settle the question of His will to heal the sincere and trusting sufferer,"I will; be thou clean." There is no evasion or ambiguity, no hesitation or conditioning. It is a great, prompt, kingly answer, and in it all ages may hear His word to us all. 3. The touch of Christ meant a great deal to a leper. It was a long time since a hand of love had touched him. It was not a told or mechanical touch. He was moved with compassion. His whole heart of love and his very life were in it. Yes, He helps us, not because His promise compels Him, but with overflowing love and unbounded condescension. He touches our immortal life with His own, and makes our leper hearts quiver with the fresh warm blood of His being. 4. He must then go to the priest at Jerusalem, and make a proper acknowledgment and testimony, and hold back all other testimony until he has borne witness before the religious authorities of the nation. And so we must bear witness, too, of His mighty works in us, and we must do it where He wants it, perhaps in the very hardest place for us, and in the very face of religious pride and opposition. It was a long journey from Galilee to Jerusalern, but if our testimony requires as great a sacrifice for Him, is not His love worth it all?
