CHAPTER III. POPULAR OBJECTIONS.
第三章　よくある反論

We will now refer to some of the most forcible objections to the glad tidings that He that forgiveth all our iniquities,"as truly and as fully also" healeth all our diseases."
さて、神が私たちのすべての罪を赦してくださったのと同じように、真実にまた完全に私たちの病気を治してくださるという喜ばしい知らせに対して寄せられる、最も説得力のあるいつくかの反論に言及することにします。

1. The Age of Miracles is past: This is commonly assumed as an axiom, and almost quoted as a Bible text. In reply, let us ask, what age are we in? There have been, and shall be, various Ages and Dispensations, viz, Paradisiacal, Antediluvian, Patriarchal, Mosaic, Christian, Millennial, Eternal.
【一】　奇跡の時代は過ぎ去った。

これは広く公理として仮定されていますし、あまつさえ聖書本文の引用のように扱われています。過去から未来までさまざまな時代と経綸（Dispensations）があります。すなわち、エデンの園の時代、洪水前までの時代、家父長制の時代、モーセの律法の時代、クリスチャンの時代、千年王国時代、永遠の時代です。
We are not in the Patriarchal or Mosaic, we are not in the Millennial, we must therefore be in the Christian.
現在は家父長制の時代でもモーセの時代でもありませんし、千年王国の時代でもありませんから、間違いなくクリスチャンの時代です。
But perhaps there are two or three Christian Ages; one for Christ and His Apostles, and one for us. And yet Paul says he lived in "these last days."
ですが、クリスチャンの時代は二つか三つに分かれるかもしれません。キリストと使徒の時代と、私たちの時代というふうに。それでもパウロは、「この終わりの日」に生きていると言いました。
He speaks of the people of his generation as those on whom "the ends of the world are come."
彼は当代の人々を「世の終わりに臨んでいる私たち」(第一コリント10:11)と言いました。
And Peter, in his sermon on the Day of Pentecost, claims for his day a prophesy of Joel for the latter days.
また、ペテロはペンテコステの日の説教で、この時代をヨエルの預言した終わりの日であると力強く言いました。
We must then be in the Age of Christ and Christianity, and if that was not the Age of Miracles then what is it?
ですから現在が間違いなくキリストとキリスト教の時代なのですから、もし奇跡の時代でないとしたら、いったい何でしょうか。
But perhaps there was to be a great gulf between the first and last periods of this Age. Perhaps it was only to begin with special manifestations of Divine Power and then shade down into sober commonplace.
しかし、あるいはこの時代の始まりと終わりとでは大きな相違があるかもしれません。神の御力が特別に顕現するのは初めのほうだけで、徐々に落ち着いて平凡な日常へと戻っていくかもしれません。
Why then should Joel say that the signal outpouring of the Holy Spirit should be "in the latter days," and the special gifts of the Spirit to the handmaids and servants, and the preternatural signs and wonders both in Earth and Heaven should be specially "before the coming of that great and terrible day of the Lord," that is, toward the close of the Christian Age, and prior to the Advent?
そうだとすると、「終わりの日」に聖霊がめざましく注がれるのはどうしてなのでしょうか。御霊の賜物がしもべにもはしためにも与えられ、天にも地にも超自然的なしるしと不思議が現れることが、とりわけ「主の大いなる輝かしい日が来る前に」、つまりクリスチャンの時代の終盤に、再臨の前にある、とヨエルが預言したのはどうしてなのでしょうか。
Why also should Paul so strongly insist, in I. Cor. xii, that the Church of Christ is one body, not two, and that the gifts of every part belong to the whole?
また、パウロが、キリストの教会は一つの身体であって二つではない、それぞれの部分の賜物は全体に属しているのだ、と強く主張したのはどうしてなのでしょうか(第一コリント12)。
If there be an essential difference between the Apostolic and later Age, then the Church is not one body but two; then the gifts of those members do not flow into our members; then the glorious figure and powerful reasoning of that chapter are false and delusive.
使徒の時代と後の時代に本質的な違いがあるなら、教会は一つの身体ではなく二つの身体になります。そうであるなら、一方の身体に属する人々の賜物は他方の身体に属する私たちには流れません。そうであるなら、あの栄光に富んだ描写と力強い論証は偽りであり、空想にすぎません。
If we are the same body, we have the same life and power. What made the Apostles more mighty than ordinary men? It was not their companionship with Jesus; it was the gift of the Holy Ghost.
私たちが同じ身体でないとすれば、同じいのちも同じ力も持ちまえせん。使徒たちを平凡な人よりも力ある者としたものは何だったのでしょうか。キリストとの交わりの深さではなく、聖霊の賜物のゆえでした。
Have we not the same? And do we not exalt the men and disparage the Spirits that make them what they were when we speak of their power as exceptional and transient? Peculiar and exceptional functions they indeed had, as the witnesses of Christ's resurrection, and the organizers of the Church on earth; but to show to men that the miraculous gifts of the Church were not confined to them, these are specially distinguished from the Apostleship in I. Cor. xii. They were conferred in preeminent degree on Stephen, Philip, and others who were not apostles at all, and they _ were committed by James to the ordinary and permanent eldership of the Church. Nay, the dear Master never contemplated or proposed any post-apostolic gulf of impotence and failure. Man's unbelief and sin have made it. The Church's own corruption has caused it. But He never desired it or provided for it. Standing midway between earth and heaven, and looking down to the nineteenth century with a love as tender, and a grace as full and potential, as He exercised to the first, and speaking in the present tense, as though we were all equally near to Him who would never be separated from us, He said, "All power is Given unto Me in HEAVEN AND IN EARTH, and lo, I AM with you ALL THE DAYS, even unto the End of the AGE" (Greek). It was to be one age, not two, and His all power was never withdrawn. He was to be a perpetual AM, and to be as near at the end as at the beginning. In fact; the work we were to do was to be but the complement of His own, nay, His Own work; for Luke says, "He began to do and to teach." He must therefore be finishing His work still. And this is just what He Himself said our work would be, "He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also (that is, they shall be Christ's work and ours, in partnership), nor shall they be aught diminished by His seeming absence; for "greater works shall he do because I go to My Father." And, indeed, so long as the ancient Church retained in even limited measure the faith and holiness of the first days, the same works were uniformly found. In the second, third, and fourth centuries, fathers as famous as Irenaeus and Tertullian, bear testimony to the prevalence of many undoubted miracles of healing, and even the raising of the dead in the name of Jesus. And as late as the fifth century supernatural events, in the case of numerous well-known and living men and women, are attested by authorities as high as Procopius and Justinian, on evidence so strong that the sober editor of Mosheim declares that he who would doubt it must be ready to question all the facts of history. The Age of Miracles is not past. The Word of God never indicated a hint of such a fact. On the contrary, they are to be among the signs of' the last day; and the very adversary himself is to counterfeit them, and send forth at last the spirits of devils working miracles, into the kings of the earth. So that the only defence against the false miracles will be the true. We are in the Age of miracles, the Age of Christ, the Age which lies between two Advents, and underneath the eye of a ceaseless Divine Presence, the Age of Power, the Age which above all other ages of time should be intensely alive.
