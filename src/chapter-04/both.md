CHAPTER IV PRINCIPLES OF DIVINE HEALING.
# 第四章 神癒の原理

There are certain principles underlying all the teachings of the Holy Scriptures with respect to healing; which it is important to understand and classify and which, when rightly understood, are most helpful to intelligent faith.
神癒に関して聖書全体の教えに基づく原理があります。よく理解し、整理することが大切です。正しく理解するなら、知性で納得した信仰のために非常に有益です。

1 THE CAUSES OF DISEASE and suffering are distinctly traced to the Fall and sinful state of man.
【一】　**病気の苦しみの原因**は他ならぬ堕落と人間の罪です。

If sickness were part of the natural constitution of things, then we might meet it wholly on natural grounds, and by natural means. But if it be part of the curse of sin, it must have its true remedy in the great Redemption. That sickness is the result of the Fall, and one of the fruits of sin no one can surely question. Death, we are told, hath passed upon all, for that all have sinned, and the greater includes the less. It is named among the curses of Deuteronomy, which God was to send for Israel's sin.
もしも病気が自然の構成物の一部であるなら、私たちは自然の観点に立って、自然の方法によって病気を扱うのがよいでしょう。しかし、もしも病気が罪による呪いの一部であるなら、贖いの中に本当の治療法があるに違いありません。病気が堕落の結果であり、罪の実の一つであることを疑う人はいません。私たちが伝えられているのは、すべての人が罪を犯したの、死がすべての人に臨むということです。そして、大は小を含みます。申命記にある、神がイスラエルの罪のために送るとされる数々の呪いの中で、病気はその一つに挙げられています。
Again, it is distinctly connected with Satan's personal agency. He was the direct instrument of Job's suffering, and our Lord definitely attributed the diseases of His time to his direct power. It was Satan who bound the paralyzed woman these eighteen years; and it was demoniacal influence which held and crushed the bodies and souls of those He delivered. If sickness be the result of evil spiritual agency, it is most evident that it must be met and counteracted by higher spiritual force, and not by mere natural treatment.
また、病気はサタンの使いと明確に結びついています。サタンはヨブの苦しみに直接の原因を作った者です。また私たちの主は神の時の病気？？を明白にサタンの直接的な力に帰しています。病気の女性を十八年間縛り付けていたのはサタンでした。主が解放した者たちの魂と肉体をつかんで押しつぶしていたのは、悪魔の影響でした。病気が悪魔の霊的な使いの結果であるとすれば、自然の治療ではなく、より高い霊的な力によって、対抗し、対処しなければなりません。
And again, on the supposition that sickness is a divine discipline and chastening it is still more evident that its removal must come, not through mechanical appliances, but through spiritual causes. It would be both ridiculous and vain for the arm of man to presume to wrest the chastening-rod from the Father's hand by physical force or skill. The only way to avert His stroke is to submit the spirit in penitence to His will, and seek in humility and faith His forgiveness and relief; so that from whatever side we look at disease, it becomes more and more evident that its remedy must be found alone in God and the Gospel of His Redemption.
さらにまた、病気を神の訓練やこらしめと仮定した場合も、病気が治るのは医療機械ではなく霊的な原因があってこそであるというのはなおもますます明らかです。御父の手にあるこらしめの杖を人間の腕で物理的な力や技術を駆使してもぎ取れると思うのは、愚かでむなしいことです。神のこらしめを避ける唯一の方法は、悔いた魂を神のみこころの前に差し出し、へりくだりと信仰をもって神の赦しと安息を求めることです。どちらの観点から病気を捕らえても、病気の治療はただ神の中にのみ、ただ神の贖いの福音の中にのみ見出されなければならないのはますます明らかになります。

2 If the disease be the result of the fall, we may expect it to be embraced in the provisions of Redemption, and would naturally look for some intimation of a remedy in THE PREPARATORY DISPENSATION which preceded the Gospel. Nor are we disappointed.
【二】　病気が堕落の結果であるなら、贖いの中に含まれていることを期待してよいし、福音に先立つ**準備的な経綸**の中に病気の癒しの暗示を求めることを自然です。

私たちは失望させられません。
The great principle that God's care and providence embraces the temporal and physical needs of his people as well as the spiritual, runs all through the Old Testament.
神の配慮と供与が神の民の霊的必要とともにこの世での肉体的必要をも含んているという偉大な原理は、旧約全体を通じても示されています。
Distinct provision for Divine healing is made in all the ordinances of Moses. And the prophetic picture of the Corning Deliverer is that of a great Physician as well as a glorious King and gracious Saviour.
モーセの律法の中にも明確に神癒があります。穀物を与える牧者という預言的な描写は、栄光の王や恵み深い救い主に加えて偉大な医者という神のイメージを与えます。
The healing of Abimelech, Miriam, Job, Naaman and Hezekiah; the case of the Leper and the Brazen Serpent, the statute at Marah, and the blessings and curses at Ebal and Gerizim, the terrible rebuke of Asa, the one hundred and third Psalm, and the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, leave the testimony of the Old Testament clear and distinct that the redemption of the body was the Divine prerogative and plan.
アビメレク、ミリアム、ヨブ、ナアマン、ヘゼキヤの癒し、らい病と青銅の蛇、マラでのおきて、ゲリジム山の祝福とエバル山ののろい、アサ王に対するきびしい叱責、詩篇103篇、イザヤ書53章、それらが肉体の贖いが神の大権でありご計画であるという旧約聖書の証言を明白で明確にしています。

3 THE PERSONAL MINISTRY OF JESUS CHRIST is the next great stage in the development of these principles. His own life was a complete summary of Christianity; and from His words and works we may surely gather the great intent of redemption. And what was the testimony of His life to physical healing? He went about their cities healing all manner of sickness and disease among the people. He healed all that had need of healing, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, "Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses." Now, when we remember that this was not an occasional incident, but a chief part of His ministry; that He began His work with it, that He continued it to the close of His life; that He did it on all possible occasions and in every variety of cases, that He did it heartily, willingly, and without leaving any doubt or question of His will; that He distinctly said to the doubting leper, "I will," and was only grieved when men hesitated to fully trust Him and when we realize that in all this He was but unfolding the real purpose of His great redemption, and revealing His own unchanging character and love, and that he has distinctly assured us that He is still "the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever "--surely we have a great principle to rest our faith upon, as secure as the Rock of Ages.

4 But redemption finds its centre IN THE CROSS of Jesus Christ, and there we must look for the fundamental principle of Divine healing. It rests on the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ. This necessarily follows from the first principle we have stated. If sickness be the result of the Fall, it must be included in the atonement of Christ, which reaches "Far as the curse is found." But, again, it is most distinctly stated in the 53rd chapter of Isaiah, as we have seen: He is said to have borne our sickness and carried our pains, the word "bear" being the very same used for the atonement of sin; the same used elsewhere to describe the act of the scapegoat in bearing away the people's guilt and the same used in the same chapter with respect to His "bearing the sins of many." In the same sense, then, as He has borne away our sins has he also borne our sicknesses. And Peter also states that "He bare our sins in His own body on the tree . . . . by whose stripes we are healed." In His own body He has borne all our bodily liabilities for sin, and our bodies are set free. That one cruel "stripe" of His-for the word is singular-summed up in it all the aches and pains of a suffering world; and there is no longer need that we should suffer what He has sufficiently borne. Thus our healing becomes a great redemption right, which we simply claim as our purchased inheritance through the blood of His Cross.

5 But there is something higher even than the Cross. It is THE RESURRECTION of our Lord. There the Gospel of Healing finds the fountain of the deepest life. The death of Christ destroys the root of sickness: sin. But it is the life of Jesus which supplies the source of health and life for our redeemed bodies. The body of Christ is the living fountain of all our vital strength. He who came forth from Joseph's tomb, with the new physical life of the resurrection, is the Head of His people for life and immortality. Not for Himself alone did He receive the power of an endless life, but as our life. He gave Him to be Head over all things for His Church, which is His body. We are members of His body, His flesh, and His bones. The healing which Christ gives us is nothing less than His own new physical life infused into our body from His own very heart, and bringing us into fellowship with His own inmost being.. That Risen and Ascended One is the fountain and measure of our strength and life. We eat His flesh and drink His blood, and He dwelleth in us, and we in Him. As He lived in the Father, so he that eateth Him shall live by Him. This is the great, the vital, the most precious principle of physical healing in the name of Jesus. It is the very life of Jesus manifested in our mortal flesh.

6 It follows from this, that it must be wholly A NEW LIFE. The Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ have made an awful gulf between the present and past of every redeemed life. Henceforth, if any man be in Christ, he is A NEW CREATION. Old things have passed away, ALL THINGS HAVE BECOME NEW. The death of Jesus has slain all our old self.. The life of Jesus is the spring of all new life. This is true of our physical life. It is not the restoration of the old natural strength to life. It is not the building up of our former constitution. It is the letting go of all the old dependencies. It is often the failure and decay of all our natural strength. It is a strength which "out of weakness is made strong," which has no resources to start with; which creation-like, is made out of nothing; which resurrection-like, comes out of the dark tomb, and the extinction of all previous help and hope. This principle is of immense importance in the practical experience of healing. So long as we look for it in the old natural life, we shall be disappointed. But when we cease to put confidence in the flesh, and look only to Christ and His supernatural life in us for our strength of body as well as spirit, we shall find that we can do all things through Christ that strengtheneth us.

7 It follows from this that the physical redemption which Christ brings, is NOT MERELY HEALING, BUT ALSO LIFE. It is not the re-adjustment of our life on the old basis, leaving it thenceforward to go like a machine upon the natural plane, but it is the infusion of a new kind of life and strength. Therefore it is as fully within the reach of persons in health as those who are diseased. It is simply a higher kind of life, the turning of life's water into His heavenly wine. Therefore, it must also be kept by constant abiding in Him, and receiving from Him. It is not a permanent deposit, but a daily dependence, a renewing of the inward man day by day, a strength which comes only as we need it, and continues only while we dwell in Him. Such a LIFE is a very sacred thing. It gives a peculiar sanctity to every look, tone, act, organ and movement of the body. We are living on the life of God, and we must live like Him and for Him. A body thus divinely quickened adds ten-fold power to the soul, and all the service of the Christian life. Words spoken in this Divine energy, works done through the very life of God, will be clothed with a positive effectiveness which must make men feel that the body as well as the spirit is indeed the very Temple of the Holy Ghost.
